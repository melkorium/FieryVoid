       "Detect Mines" entries - and getEWLeft() is measured against it by every assign path.
       Adding 3 to that one number would let an ordinary fighter spend its mine-detection allowance
       on OEW AND let a Mapmaker spend its OEW pool on mine detection, in both directions and
       silently. So getScannerOutput() is left exactly as it was and the OEW/DEW paths consult

       ⚠️⚠️ THE FLIGHT TEST IS `ship.flight`, NOT `isFlightEwPool`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
       On ANY flight, OEW and DEW come out of the flight pool - and an ordinary flight's pool is
       0, so it can never allocate either. Asking isFlightEwPool here instead would fall through
       to getEWLeft() for an ordinary flight, which answers with its MINE-DETECTION allowance, and
       a Kotha would happily buy 2 points of OEW with the Offensive Bonus it was supposed to be
       spending on mine detection. No button offers that today (sourceCanAllocateOEW refuses a
       flight without a pool) and EW::clampFlightEw drops it server-side either way - but the

       A Mastership refitted with ELINT Sensor Modules spends EW out of TWO pools (rulings R7, R8):

         N  the scanner    (getScannerOutput, already -2 per module)  OEW, DEW, CCEW, Detect Mines
         M  the modules    (live modules' output)                     OEW and the six ELINT functions,

       N can never pay for an ELINT function; M never becomes DEW. Allocation is NOT blocked by the
       arcs (R16) - the after-movement check (ElintModules.php) cuts whatever is then out of arc, and
       those points are simply lost (R9). This block only decides WHICH pool pays (plan D15):
         ELINT functions                       from M
         OEW on a unit inside a live arc NOW   from N first, then from what M has left
         every other OEW                       from N only - module points spent there would only be lost
       OEW is a normal function, so the scanner pays it first: scanner-paid OEW survives the target
       leaving the arc, module-paid OEW does not (and losing it can cost the lock - user, 2026-10-08).
       The split is worked out from this turn's totals every time, so click order never matters.

       "Waymarkers should also not use EW on transition Docking/Launching turns, nor should ships
       have the opportunity to use any targeted EW on it." Its sensors are slaved to the manoeuvre
       for the turn it spends clamped to the carrier's aft.

       ⚠️ IT KEEPS ITS DEW (user ruling, same day). Only ACTIVE allocations stop - OEW, CCEW, DIST,
       JAM, SOEW, SDEW, BDEW and the two Detect types. Unspent points still fall into DEW through
       convertUnusedToDEW exactly as they do for every other ship, so the rider is no easier to hit
       than usual; what it loses is the ability to spend, and what its enemies lose is the lock.
       An attacker with no lock then takes the ordinary doubled range penalty, which is the engine's
       standing rule and is left alone.

       UNCOMMITTED one - the server has not been told about it and by definition cannot be, because
       the whole point of the allowance is that the player spends it at the end of the Movement
       segment on the strength of where they ended up. shipManager.getShipPosition() already
       returns the plotted position during Movement, so this sweep tracks the drag for free.

       the server's twin does: in all but a handful of games nothing is an EW Detector, and a name

       ⚠️ `effectiveRange` is the SERVER's answer after destruction and power-down; the two local
       tests after it exist because a player may power a detector down during Initial Orders and
       the server will not know until the phase is committed - which is exactly the window in which
