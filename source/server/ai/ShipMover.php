/**
 * CPU opponent - the legal move generator for SHIPS (TACTICAL_AI_PLAN.md section 5.4, stage T1b).
 *
 * Movement legality lives in the client (source/public/client/movement.js). The server checks a
 * submitted move only for "was the stated cost paid through thrusters that still exist"
 * (Movement::validateThrustPayment); what a turn costs, when it is allowed, how much the engine
 * has and what a thruster may carry are all decided by the page. A bot has no page, so this class
 * is a PORT of those rules onto the server's own ship objects: it plots one ship's Movement phase
 * order by order, exactly as a player clicks it, and never produces a row the page would refuse.
 *
 *   $mover = ShipMover::forShip($ship, $gamedata);   // null = not a hull this class handles
 *   $mover->options();                               // what may be ordered next
 *   $mover->apply('turnleft');                       // order it (false = refused, nothing changed)
 *   $mover->finish();                                // straight on for the hexes that are left
 *   $mover->rows();                                  // this turn's rows, as AIOrderBuilder posts them
 *
 * ⚠️ MIRROR OF movement.js. Each private method names the client function it ports. Change a
 * movement rule in the client and this must follow - tests/ai/shipMoverHarness.php replays every
 * plan through the real movement.js under node and fails on any difference, in BOTH directions
 * (a row the page would refuse, and an order the page offers that this class does not).
 *
 * WHAT IT HANDLES (stage T1b): ordinary hulls - speed changes, straight moves, turns (with extra
 * thrust to shorten the turn delay), sideslips, and paying for each through the right thrusters.
 * Thruster criticals (Half Efficiency, First Thrust Ignored), lost thrusters, engine damage and
 * boost, agile snap turns, a rolled or reversed ship, Elite / Poor Crew, a Quartermaster and
 * docked LCVs are all costed as the page costs them.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT: pivots, rolls, jinking, extended turns, jump-out, half-phasing, contraction.
 * It never orders one. A ship that arrives in such a state (still pivoting or rolling from last
 * turn) is offered only what the page would still allow it, which is usually "straight on".
 * Hulls it refuses outright are listed in unsupportedReason(): flights (AutomatedMovement plots
 * those), bases, OSATs, mines, terrain, gravitic and Mindrider drives, and a ship carrying or
 * riding another unit.
 *
 * ONE POLICY OF ITS OWN: it never overthrusts. The page lets a thruster carry up to twice its
 * rating at the risk of a critical; a bot's thrusters carry their rating and no more.
