/**
 * CPU opponent - the fallback orders (TACTICAL_AI_PLAN.md section 3.3, principle P3).
 *
 * For every phase, the safest legal "do nothing": the orders a bot submits when it has no decider
 * for the phase yet, and the ones it falls back to when a decider's orders are refused. A game
 * with a bot in it can therefore always move on.
 *
 *   Deployment (-1)     first free legal hex of the slot's deployment zone, as the unit stands
 *   Initial Orders (1)  all EW to defence; no power changes, no ballistics
 *   Movement (2)        straight on at the current speed
 *   Pre-Firing (5)      nothing
 *   Firing (3)          nothing (the server still intercepts by itself)
 *
 * Until the deciders exist (stages T1-T5) these ARE the bot's play.
 *
 * NOT YET, and each waits for the stage that owns it:
 *   - Initial Orders does not clear negative power (T3, PowerDecider). The server does not refuse
 *     a commit for it - the client does - so nothing is rejected meanwhile.
 *   - Movement does not turn away from a blocked hex or the map edge (T1b, ShipMover). A unit
 *     flying straight into terrain collides, as a human's would.
 *
 * Every method returns the plain entries AIOrderBuilder describes - one per unit the bot owns.
