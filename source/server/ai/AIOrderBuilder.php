 * CPU opponent - turns decided orders into a submission (TACTICAL_AI_PLAN.md section 3.2 step 4).
 *
 * A bot's orders are written as THE SAME PLAIN ARRAY A BROWSER POSTS (ajaxInterface.construcGamedata)
 * and built into ships by the same code that builds a browser's (ShipPayload). That is deliberate:
 * every Phase::process() is written for POST-side ships and reads the unit's real state from the
 * loaded gamedata itself. Handing process() the LOADED ship objects instead would be wrong - for
 * one, Initial Orders stores every power entry a submitted system carries, so a loaded ship would
 * have its stored rows written a second time.
 *
 * So the rule for the bot is the browser's rule: an entry carries only THIS turn's new orders.
