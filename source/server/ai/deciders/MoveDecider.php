 * CPU opponent - Movement (TACTICAL_AI_PLAN.md sections 3.3 and 5.4).

 * STAGE T1b: there is no tactics here yet. A ship HOLDS ITS COURSE - straight on at its speed -
 * unless that would fly it into terrain or off the map, this turn or the next; then it takes the
 * plainest legal plan ShipMover has that does not. That closes the gap the T0 fallback left
 * ("movement never turns away from terrain or the map edge"). Choosing where to go - targets,
 * range bands, arcs - is stage T5, and replaces score() below.
 *
 * Units ShipMover does not plot for (flights, gravitic hulls, a ship carrying another...) keep
 * the fallback's rows: straight on.
